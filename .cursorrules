**Key Features:**  
- **Misti API Integration** – Automatic code analysis in the editor.  
- **Custom Analyzer Support** – Users can create and integrate their own analyzers.  
- **Configurable Rules** – Settings for enabling/disabling analyzers.  
- **AI Interaction** – Use analysis results to refine AI-generated code.
